### Description
<p>
  This was my Cross Course Assignment where we had to make a website from a selected brief, for me that was SquareEyes.
  The target audience was people aged 25 to 40 that are interested in cinema, and enjoy watching interesting and high-quality films.
  The Site Architecture
  <ul>
  <li> Homepage </li>
  <li> List of videos page </li>
  <li> A video page showing the product details </li>
  <li> A checkout page</li>
  <li> A checkout success page</li>
  <li> About page</li>
  <li> Contact page</li>
  </ul>
  I did everyghing from the beginning from making the wireframes and prototype to HMTL and CSS. 
  This site also use JavaScript to fetch an API from headless WordPress page that i also did make.
