## Description

This project is a big showcase of what I've learned at Noroff over the past year. I started by designing it on Figma and sketching the layout on paper, putting a lot of thought into how it looks and how people will use it. Then, I built the site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and fecthing it to the WordPress post API for my project.

What's cool is that I made it connect with WordPress, where we get blog posts. It's like a special way of organizing things. So, my project isn't just a website; it's a smart website that changes and updates itself. This whole journey—from planning on Figma to making it work with WordPress and tracking user data with Hotjar—shows everything I've learned this year.

## Acknowledgments

This was my first Project Exam, and I made a lot of mistakes. But I tried really hard to make the website work well. This project gave me motivation and showed me things I need to get better at on my own. I had a lot of fun with this project, especially when I figured out how to get the WordPress API to work with my site – that made me really happy!
